# solidity-boilerplate

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/maxsam4/solidity-boilerplate.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is the boilerplate code I use for my solidity smart contract projects.

It has a few node modules added as dev-dependencies, truffle config with default contracts, travis config, solcover config and a few test helpers.
